> We designed Code Junction using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  Code Junction is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React JS development framework](https://reactjs.org/). React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building SPA (single web application) and user interfaces or UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù.

-For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [mongodb] which allows the app to store all data in different schema and handler the big data insid the app

-This project also uses [Framer-Motion] in order to animate components and add fun transitions between pages.

- üö® Currently, AI advice are not the best guide to rely on but hopefully very soon that will not be the case. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["mono space"](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Audiowide&display=swap) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
